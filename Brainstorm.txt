Ideas

KISS (KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID)

GOAL: To successful raise your "Apollo Baby" by exercising and working out. 
Baby only grows by feeding it active points (AP), which comes from being active meaning Walking, Running, Jogging, Working Out etc. Anything that involves stimulating the heart while you are holding your phone. 
FAILURE: If you starve your child, it will go into SADothesis which is becoming sad and reverts back into the only thing that it felt sercure, back into crystal egg form like a caterpillar. But the process isnt complete, you have a week to stop the process by giving more ap to your pet, if you fail to complete it then it will revert back to an egg and level 1 but if you stop it in time, then you get back your pet at its normal stats and more affection to its parent.  

KEY TO GET TO THE GYM: If you are at the gym for a certain period of time, you get a random drop that results in increase stats, exp boost, potions (when battles happen)

Based off the active difficulty 

- The amount of AP needed to hatch the Apollo Baby will increase exponentialty but with increased difficulty 
it means increase chance of getting high tier Apollo Baby

Active difficulty means you have to move more etc. 

Sweatcoins base steps off their calcuations to avoid just shaking the phone and increasing steps
Will follow suit and have calcuations on steps 


As i plan to flesh out ideas etc. For now the goal is to walk a certain amount of steps and hatch your egg <---- MAIN GOAL

TIMELINE BASED OFF THE SCRUM METHOD SO BREAKING IT UP INTO PIECES

- Familarity with FLUTTER
- same with FIREBASE
- APP ROADMAP
- UI DESIGNS
- APP CREATION

PIECE 1 - EGG that hatch because of steps and login
PIECE 2 - difficulty and 4 more different egg monster, based off diffuculty, increase user profile
PIECE 3 - Health and RPG elements

MORE TO COME
