Ideas

KISS (KEEP IT SIMPLE, STUPID)

GOAL: To successful raise your "Apollo Baby" by exercising and working out. 
Baby only grows by feeding it active points (AP), which comes from being active meaning Walking, Running, Jogging, Working Out etc. Anything that involves stimulating the heart while you are holding your phone. 
FAILURE: your Apollo Baby dies and can become a Neo Apollo Baby which is limbo between life and death, if you make a bet with the Ferryman.

THE BET: Put in 5 to 20 dollars that states you will go on a streak of reaching your goal for one week. Win the bet, ferryman gives you your baby back and money, failure means lost of baby and money. If you wish to play again, 1.99 to pay for a new apollo baby and start over

Based off the active difficulty 

- The amount of AP needed to hatch the Apollo Baby will increase exponentialty but with increased difficulty 
it means increase chance of getting high tier Apollo Baby

Active difficulty means you have to move more etc. 

Sweatcoins base steps off their calcuations to avoid just shaking the phone and increasing steps
Will follow suit and have calcuations on steps 


As i plan to flesh out ideas etc. For now the goal is to walk a certain amount of steps and hatch your egg ---- MAIN GOAL
